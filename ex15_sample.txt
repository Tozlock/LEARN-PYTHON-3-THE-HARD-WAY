A few fancy things are going on in this file, so let’s break it down real quickly:
* Lines 1–3 use argv to get a filename. Next we have line 5, where we use a new command,
open. Right now, run pydoc open and read the instructions. Notice how, like your own scripts
and input, it takes a parameter and returns a value you can set to your own variable. You just
opened a file.

* Line 7 prints a little message, but on line 8 we have something very new and exciting. We
call a function on txt named read. What you get back from open is a file, and it also
has commands you can give it. You give a file a command by using the . (dot or period), the
name of the command, and parameters, just like with open and input. The difference is that
txt.read() says, “Hey txt! Do your read command with no parameters!”
